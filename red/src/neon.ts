// The storage tier's templates, read from the SHA-pinned `package-neon-red`
// dependency rather than copied into this repository.
//
// This is red's counterpart of green's classpath resolution: green publishes
// `src/resources` from neon's deps.edn and names the templates as namespaced
// keywords, and neon's package.json publishes `red/resources` in its `files`
// list, so the same twelve Ansible templates plus the three ansible-local ones
// are on disk inside the installed package. A copy of a tier this subtle
// drifts, and the drift is silent — so there is no copy in either colour.
//
// Resolved from the package entry rather than imported by subpath: neon's
// exports map admits the bare specifier "." alone, and `with { type: "text" }`
// needs a static path a bundler can see. The same technique resolves ONCE's
// unexported ssh module in once.ts.
//
// The cost is real coupling — bumping the pin in package.json can break this
// package. That is deliberate: `scripts/golden.sh` renders the merged Neon+n8n
// tree, so a pin bump shows up as a reviewable diff instead of a surprise on a
// host.
